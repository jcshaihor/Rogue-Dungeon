# Rogue-Dungeon
Risk everything. Escape with riches—or die trying.

### **Short Description**

A high-stakes multiplayer 3D dungeon crawler where every run matters. Choose your class, grow stronger, and dive into dangerous dungeons for loot and power. Escape alive to keep your rewards—die, and lose everything.

### **About This Game**

Enter deadly dungeons alone or with other players in this multiplayer 3D dungeon crawler built around risk and reward. Every dungeon run offers powerful loot, rare resources, and new abilities—but failure comes at a cost.

Choose from distinct character classes, each with their own playstyle. As you level up, unlock new abilities and increase your character’s power. Explore hostile dungeons filled with enemies, hidden rewards, and escalating danger.

Survival means you escape with everything you’ve earned. Death means losing all progress made during that dungeon run. Decide how far to push your luck before it’s too late.
